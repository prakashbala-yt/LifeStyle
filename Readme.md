## 🛠️ How to Start as a Lifestyle Creator

Here’s a roadmap to help you launch and grow:

### 1. Define Your Niche
Even within lifestyle, choose a focus—e.g., minimalist living, budget travel, or urban wellness.

### 2. Pick Your Platforms
Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok are ideal for visual storytelling. Blogs and newsletters work well for deeper content.

### 3. Create a Content Calendar
Plan themes like “Self-Care Sundays” or “Travel Tip Tuesdays” to stay consistent.

Share real stories, routines, and lessons learned. Audiences crave relatability over perfection.

### 5. Use B-Roll and Repurpose
Film everyday moments—morning routines, grocery hauls, or workspace setups—and reuse them across formats
